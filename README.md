# Single Map AutoMod – Quaver Plugin

A modular validation tool for Quaver map editors. Helps identify common issues for rankable maps in individual difficulties with a clean and readable interface.

## 🔧 Core Features

- 🎯 **Per-Difficulty Checks**  
  Validate your map as any standard difficulty (Easy, Hard, Insane, etc.).

- 🔍 **"Go To" Navigation**  
  Some logs let you jump directly to the affected note in the editor.

- 🚫 **Overlap & Duplicate Detection**  
  Automatically detects overlapping or duplicated notes in the same column.

- 🟩 **Mapped Activity Check**  
  Ensures that at least 75% of the song has mapped content, discounting long pauses.

- 🧩 **All Lanes Must Be Used**  
  Validates that each required column contains at least one note. Warns if 7K lanes are missing.
